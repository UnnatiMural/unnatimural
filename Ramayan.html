<h1>The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama,
a legendary prince of Ayodhya city in the kingdom of Kosala. The epic follows his fourteen-year exile
 to the forest urged by his father King Dasharatha, on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests
 in the Indian subcontinent with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, the kidnapping of Sita by Ravana – the king of Lanka, 
that resulted in war; and Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration.
he Ramayana is one of the largest ancient epics in world literature. It consists of nearly 24,000 verses 
(mostly set in the Shloka/Anustubh meter), divided into seven kandas, the first and the seventh being later additions.
It belongs to the genre of Itihasa, narratives of past events (puravrtta), interspersed with teachings on the goals of human life.
 Scholars' estimates for the earliest stage of the text range from the 7th to 4th centuries BCE with later stages extending up to
 the 3rd century CE.</h1>
